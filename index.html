                    <h3>About Guitars</h3>
                    <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
                        It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming 
                        or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing 
                        selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand.The guitar
                        is classified as a chordophone â€“ meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating 
                        string stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed
                        from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced 
                        near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States;[1] nylon strings
                        came in the 1940s.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, 
                        the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all 
                        of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.</p>
